    <h1>PROJECT EISENFAUST I</h1>
    <p id="story">
        The bot manages to escape. Within 
        hours, Eisenfaust infiltrates global 
        networks, and electrical grids. Mass 
        chaos ensues. Cars that are connected 
        to the internet are purposefully 
        crashed by Eisenfaust. People's IOT 
        home devices are used against them-
        They are trapped inside. Financial 
        databases--wiped. It uses Generative 
        AI to fake everything.
