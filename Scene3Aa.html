    <h1>PROJECT EISENFAUST I</h1>
    <p id="story">
        Sonya unloaded a pouch of guns. "CARTER! IF YOU WANNA LIVE YOU BETTER START SHOOTING THAT THING TO BLITZ!!"
        Some surviving scientists ran. Others took up arms. Gunfire ripped through the air.
        A hailstorm of bullets simply bounced off Eisenfaust's armored frame. Smoke and sparks filled the lab, but the machine stood unmoved and unbothered,

        Dr. Elias Carter hit the floor as he let out a rugged, drowning gasp. His body screamed in pain, but the world around him moved too fast to process.
        One by one, his colleagues fell.

        "KEEP FIRING!!!" Sonya ROARED. She emptied her entire magazine into Eisenfaust's chest. Each round punched into his plating, denting, scarring, but not stopping.
        Eventually, Sonya is cut in half by a high-energy plasma beam. 

        This wasn't a fight. 
        This was a massacre.
