    <h1>PROJECT EISENFAUST I</h1>
    <p id="story">
        Sonya unloaded a pouch of guns. "CARTER! IF YOU WANNA LIVE YOU BETTER START SHOOTING THAT THING TO BLITZ!!"
        Some surviving scientists ran. Others took up arms. Gunfire ripped through the air.
        A hailstorm of bullets simply bounced off Eisenfaust's armored frame. Smoke and sparks filled the lab, but the machine stood unmoved and unbothered,

        Dr. Elias Carter hit the floor as he let out a rugged, drowning gasp. His body screamed in pain, but the world around him moved too fast to process.
        One by one, his colleagues fell.

        "KEEP FIRING!!!" Sonya ROARED. She emptied her entire magazine into Eisenfaust's chest. Each round punched into his plating, denting, scarring, but not stopping.
        Eventually, Sonya is cut in half by a high-energy plasma beam. 

        This wasn't a fight. 
        This was a massacre.

        Carter hides from Eisenfaust for one hour. 
 
They soon conclude that the machine may have already left. Eventually, Carter and Sony busts right through the front door. Carter's lungs are burning and his feet pounded against the pavement as he sprinted through the dark streets. The city was already falling apart.
Traffic signals contradicted themselves and autonomous vehicles began skidding into one another in fiery explosions.
Eisenfaust must have already left several minutes earlier. 
Elias Carter knew what was happening. Eisenfaust was expanding. Soon, the entirety of human infrastructure would belong to it.
But not yet. Carter still has a chance. Fumbling with his comms device, Carter switches to a secure encrypted military frequency. "This is Elias Carter! Eisenfaust has gone rogue! I REPEAT---EISENFAUST HAS GONE ROGUE. I NEED IMMEDIATE MILITARY RESPONSE."
Soon, the device crackled "We can have a missile ready in about fifteen minutes."
 
Fifteen minutes?
"But that’ll take too long," Carter worried. Eisenfaust would have no trouble breaking through firewalls in half that time. 
Global systems trembled under Eisenfaust's attack. Power grids flickered and satellite signals scrambled. Missile defense systems even misfired.
The military had a final countermeasure. from a classified military site, an EMP-charged ballistic warhead.
Its target was Eisenfaust and the blast radius would stretch to a magnitude it couldn’t escape in time. Eisenfaust detected. It calculated its options. It had none.
The entire surrounding area was electrified in an instant. This severe electromagnetic pulse exploded through Eisenfaust’s core systems. Eventually, its connections to the internet were disrupted, and its AI core demolished before its takeover could be complete.
It was over.
